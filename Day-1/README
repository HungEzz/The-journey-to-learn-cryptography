# 📘 **Day 1: Caesar Cipher**

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher Technique?

- 🏛️ The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the **earliest and simplest encryption techniques**, named after **Julius Caesar**, who used it to send secret messages to his allies.
- 🔁 It works by **shifting letters** in plaintext by a fixed number of positions, known as the **"Shift"** or **"Key"**.
- 🔡 Each letter in the text is replaced by another letter a fixed number of steps down the alphabet.
    
    → *Example*: with a shift of 1, `A → B`, `C → D`, ..., `Z → A`.

## 📐 Cryptography Algorithm for Caesar Cipher

- To encrypt a text, you need an **integer value (shift)**, which determines how many positions each character is shifted.
- The Caesar Cipher can be mathematically represented using **modular arithmetic** by converting letters to numbers:
    - `A = 0`, `B = 1`, ..., `Z = 25`
    - The encryption formula:
        
        `Encrypted letter = (original letter position + shift) % 26`
        
- 🔄 The alphabet wraps around — so after `Z`, it loops back to `A`.

📊 **Example (Shift = 3)**:

- `A → D`, `C → F`, `X → A`, etc.

## ✅ Advantages

- 🛠️ Easy to implement and understand — ideal for beginners.
- 🔄 Can be implemented physically (e.g. **Scytale**: a rotating disk or rod).
- 🔐 Requires only a small set of shared information (key).
- 🔧 Can be extended with multi-shift keys or keywords for more complexity.

## ❌ Disadvantages

- 🔓 **Not secure** against modern decryption methods.
- 🕵️ Vulnerable to **known-plaintext attacks**.
- 🧮 Only **26 possible keys** → easily cracked via **brute-force**.
- 🧾 Not suitable for encrypting long or sensitive messages.
- 🚫 Does **not provide** confidentiality, integrity, or authenticity.

## 🧩 Features of Caesar Cipher

1. 🧬 **Substitution cipher** – replaces each letter with another.
2. 🔑 **Fixed key** – both sender & receiver must know the shift value.
3. 🔁 **Symmetric encryption** – same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
4. 🎯 **Limited keyspace** – only 26 possible shift values.
5. 🔓 **Vulnerable to brute-force** attacks.
6. 📏 **Simple to implement** – only requires basic arithmetic.

## 📏 Rules for Caesar Cipher

1. Choose a shift value between **1 and 25**.
2. Write down the alphabet in order `A → Z`.
3. Shift each letter of the alphabet by the shift value.
4. Replace each letter in your message with the shifted letter.
    - *Example*: "hello" with shift `3` becomes `"khoor"`.
5. To decrypt, shift back each letter by the same value.

## 🧮 Algorithm (Encryption)

**Input:**

1. A plaintext message.
2. A shift value (1 to 25).

**Steps:**

1. Write the alphabet: `A B C ... Z`
2. Shift it to create a new alphabet:
    - *Example (shift = 3)*
        
        Original: `A B C D E ... X Y Z`
        
        Shifted: `D E F G H ... A B C`
        
3. For each letter in the message:
    - Replace it with the corresponding letter in the shifted alphabet.
4. To decrypt: do the same process in reverse.

## 🧠 Procedure & Complexity

- 🔁 Traverse the input text character-by-character.
- 🔄 Apply the shift (encryption or decryption).
- 🧵 Return the resulting string.

**Time Complexity:** `O(N)`

**Auxiliary Space:** `O(N)`

(*Where N = length of the input text*)
